This repository contains all my solutions to LeetCode exercises. Each solution is organized by problem and includes code, explanations, and any relevant notes.

## Structure
- Each problem is stored in its own directory.
- Solutions are written in the TypeScript language.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aal89/leetcode.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the desired problem directory to view the solution.

## Install & usage

To execute an exercise run the following:

nvm use # one time or depending on how many times you switch node versions
npm i # one time to install all dependencies
